The Manabu project is comprised of a set of software components that together
form the Backstage platform. These components are both plugins as well as core
platform libraries and tools. Each component is distributed as a collection of
[packages](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)>), which in the end is
what you end up consuming as an adopter of Backstage.

The number of Backstage packages that build up an application can be quite
large, in the order of hundreds, with just the core platform packages being
counted in the dozen. This creates a challenge for the integrators of a
Backstage project, as there are a lot of moving parts and pieces to keep up to
date.

Our solution to this is collecting our most used components and their packages
into an umbrella version that we call a Backstage release. Each release is a
collection of packages at specific versions that have been verified to work
together. Think of it as a toolbox that comes with batteries included, but you
can always add more plugins and libraries from the open source ecosystem as well
as build your own.
